// PreToolUse guard: never push to a branch whose PR has already merged.
//
// In Branch-and-PR, once the PR merges the feature branch is frozen: further
// pushes strand off the integration branch with no signal, and the kit's own
// rituals keep writing records (Chapters, decisions, the register) late. This
// blocks a push to a branch with a MERGED pull request and tells the agent to
// open a doc PR against the integration branch instead. Pushed is not merged.
//
// SAFETY: fails OPEN. It blocks only when it positively confirms a MERGED PR for
// the target branch via the host CLI. Anything else (not a push, an integration
// branch, no CLI, not authenticated, no PR, query error, timeout, parse failure)
// exits 0 (allow). A guard that cannot tell never blocks.

// The switch exists for tests: a suite spawns this hook and its faked host CLI
// on a box under parallel load, paying spawn costs a developer's machine never

// missing block. Turning the deadline off removes that reading entirely rather
// than betting on a larger number, since no margin is wide enough to be a

// SAFETY: removing a deadline can only remove ETIMEDOUT, every failure path in
// this hook is fail-open, so no value of this switch can stand the guard down
// and the switch can only make it more likely to block.

// the origin URL) comes from a git read. Nothing here needs any of them, since
// every call names the repository it means through its own cwd.
//
// That cwd is the repository under inspection, which is what makes the second

// through a shell, and cmd.exe resolves a bare command name against its
// working directory before PATH, so a repository carrying a file named
// git.cmd, gh.cmd or az.cmd is what runs. cmd.exe reads the suppressing
// variable from its own environment, unlike libuv, which reads it from the
// spawning process, so setting it here closes the route for all six queries
// while leaving the shell form the az shim needs. hooks/kit-git-lib.js closes

// Each query carries its own budget, exactly as production does: nothing here

// The arguments of the `git push` in a command string, or null when it holds
// none to guard. The returned text is that one command's operands and stops
// where the command does.
//
// A command begins at the start of the string or just after a shell separator,
// redirect, subshell opener, backtick, or line break, optionally behind one or
// more NAME=value assignment prefixes (`GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -i k" git push`
// is command position in every POSIX shell), and it ends at the next separator.
// The cut set extends readonly-agent-guard.js's, whose `segment` cuts on
// /[;|&<>)\n\x01]/: that hook masks substitutions to \x01 sentinels before it
// cuts, so a backtick reaches its cut as a sentinel, while this hook does no
// masking and must cut on the literal backtick itself. The set is replicated
// rather than shared: that hook exports nothing, so sharing would mean building
// an export surface on a second deny guard and loading it on every Bash call,
// and what has to agree between the two is this one-line cut set rather than
// the quote and heredoc masking that surrounds it there.
//
// Every shape in the set matters. A newline ends a command as surely as a
// semicolon, and a two-line Bash call is what a model routinely writes, so
// without it the push on line two is not seen at all. `(` opens a command and
// `)` closes one, so a push in a subshell is neither missed nor allowed to
// swallow what follows, and a backtick does both jobs at once. And a command
// that ends at its own separator is what keeps a later flag, in
// `git push origin x && ls -d`, out of the operands read below.
//
// What the parser catches is exactly a textual `git push` at a command position
// as defined above, and both error directions carry residue. Quoted text is not
// masked, so a separator inside a quoted argument still opens a command
// position and prose like `echo "x; git push origin b"` is read as a push:
// over-detection, a needless query and at worst a needless block. The missed
// direction's residue is the class of pushes the shell reaches through a layer
// this parser does not model: a quoted string later executed as code, a
// backslash-newline continuation between `git` and `push`, an interposed runner
// (`echo b | xargs git push origin`), an alias or shell function; and within
// one compound command only the first command-position push is guarded. Each of
// those is a known, deliberately unfixed gap: closing the class means modeling
// the shell, which is readonly-agent-guard.js's job, not this one's.
