// SessionStart hook: keep the Code-surface operating doctrine current, always-on.
//
// The doctrine is single-sourced as the operating-instructions skill (which rides
// plugin auto-update to every surface). On Claude Code we want it ALWAYS-ON, not
// on-demand, so this hook maintains a stable, kit-owned file that the user's
// ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md imports:
//
//   0. Move the files an install under the plugin's former name wrote (the
//      doctrine file, its stamp and the kaizen signpost) onto the current names,
//      never over a file already under the current name, and swap a CLAUDE.md
//      line that is exactly the former import token for the current one, saying
//      so in one additionalContext line.
//   1. Read the installed skill's SKILL.md from CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT, strip the YAML
//      frontmatter, and write one header line plus the body to
//      ~/.claude/grimoire-doctrine.md whenever it differs. Reading from
//      CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT each session means the current (auto-updated) plugin is
//      always the source, so the version-stamped cache path never leaks into the
//      import and the import line never goes stale. The header is an HTML comment
//      naming this hook as the writer and the skill as the source of truth, so a
//      hand edit meets its owner; it is never part of the skill body, and the
//      doctor's comparison strips it.
//      A long-lived session can still run on a superseded plugin cache, so every
//      write records grimoire-doctrine.stamp.json beside the file: the writer's
//      payload time (the skill file's mtime, which the install copies from the
//      marketplace clone, so a later version whose skill changed carries a later
//      time), its build hash from .claude-plugin/build-info.json ("unknown" where
//      the root carries none, as a marketplace install does), and its root's
//      directory name, which on a marketplace install is the commit's short hash.
//      A writer whose payload time is older than the
//      stamped one declines to write where the file exists; where it is absent
//      there is no newer text to keep, so the writer writes and stamps. At a
//      session start (startup or resume) a decline says so in one
//      additionalContext line naming both writers' root directories and hashes,
//      and the stamp whose deletion lets the next session write; at clear and
//      compact it declines silently. The order is time alone: two hashes have no
//      order, so the hash rides for the decline line only. A missing or malformed
//      stamp reads as no stamp, and the writer writes and stamps.
//   2. If ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md does not import that file yet, OFFER (never silently
//      perform) to add the one-line `@grimoire-doctrine.md` import. The doctrine
//      file is kit-owned and safe to overwrite silently; the user's personal
//      CLAUDE.md is not, so adding to it stays consent-gated at the agent layer.
//      The one change made to it unprompted is step 0's swap of a line that is
//      exactly the former import token, which is reported after it lands.
//
// SAFETY: fails OPEN and silent. Missing skill, unreadable/unwritable paths, an
// up-to-date file with the import already present, or any error -> exit 0, no
// output. The one error that prints is a step 0 swap that leaves CLAUDE.md
// missing, which names the kept temp file so the user can put it back.
