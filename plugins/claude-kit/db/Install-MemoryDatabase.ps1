#Requires -Version 7.0
# Installs or upgrades the shared memory index on a SQL Server host: the mem
# schema, its full-text catalog and index, every procedure, the three roles,
# the five logins and the sandbox rows. Re-runnable: every script under
# Schema, FullText, Procedures, Security and Version guards its own creation
# or is a repeatable ALTER, GRANT or DENY, so a second run against an
# installed host applies no change and says so on its own output.
#
# The script order is the directory order Schema, FullText, Procedures,
# Security, Version, and inside each directory the ordinal order of the file names,
# whose numeric prefixes are what fix it. Each script runs through sqlcmd
# with -b, so the first failing statement stops the whole run with a
# non-zero exit and the failing file named.
#
# What this installer never does. It never drops a table and never alters a
# column type: a schema change of that shape is a new script under Schema,
# written to guard on the catalog, and never an edit to this file. It refuses
# to run when mem.SchemaVersion already holds a version newer than the one it
# carries, because applying older scripts over a newer schema is how a column
# or a grant silently goes backward. And it never prints, logs or passes on a
# command line any password: the installing connection's password under SQL
# authentication is read from the SQLCMDPASSWORD environment variable and
# from nowhere else, and each generated login password reaches its CREATE
# LOGIN as a sqlcmd scripting variable set in the sqlcmd process's
# environment. Every connection asks for encryption (-N), so no password
# crosses the wire in the clear; -TrustServerCertificate adds -C for an
# instance whose certificate the client cannot validate.
#
# The five logins are created only where absent, each with a fresh random
# password. Those passwords are written once to the logins file, created
# exclusively and immediately before Security/020-Logins.sql runs, so a run
# that fails earlier leaves no file holding passwords that reached no server,
# and no login is ever created before its password is on disk. An existing
# file is never overwritten: a run that would need to create a login while
# the file exists stops before touching the server, and its refusal says
# which of the logins that file names are on the server and which are not.
# A login already on the server keeps its password, so a later run leaves
# both the logins and the file alone.
#
# Output is one line per fact, in the order the run reaches them: the server
# and authentication, the sqlcmd resolved, the database created or present,
# the schema version carried and installed, one Applied line per script
# reading changed or no change with the logins file line just before the
# logins script, one Login line per login reading created or present, and a
# Summary line with the two counts. A refusal is one line starting FAIL:
# naming the reason, then exit 1.
#
# The changed / no change reading is a digest of the catalog state this
# installer owns, taken before the run and after each script: the mem schema
# and every object in it; every column with its type, length, precision,
# nullability, collation, identity flag and computed definition; every module
# definition; every index with its key and included columns, ordering and
# filter; every check, default and foreign key definition; every mem_ and
# kit_ principal with its SID, default schema, role memberships and
# permissions; the five server logins with their SIDs, default databases and
# disabled flags; the full-text catalog and index with its columns; and the
# rows of mem.Sandbox and mem.SchemaVersion. Outside it: a login's password,
# which no catalog exposes; the audit timestamps; and the data rows of every
# table but those two. So a run that touched nothing reads as no change, and
# a password change alone reads as no change too.
