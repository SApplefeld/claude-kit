# It measures rather than repairs. Each check prints one line. Check 2 prints a
# second whenever it reached the server, saying whether the configured database
# is there: INFO where the name was read, FAIL where the config's name is one
# this script will not interpolate. So a reader keying on the check number finds
# two lines at check 2 on a run that reached the server and one on a run that
# did not. The script exits non-zero when any check FAILs, which is what makes
# it serve both as a hand-run instrument during setup and as the doctor's
# memory-database step.

#
# OUTPUT IS A CONTRACT, not a convenience. Every line is
#
#   <STATUS>  <n>. <check name>: <measured value>
#
# with STATUS one of PASS, FAIL or INFO and <n> the check's number. The doctor
# parses these lines, so the shape, the numbers and the names are stable text.
# Check number 0 belongs to the client config itself, which is read before any
# check runs and before anything reaches the network.
#
# Exit code: 0 when nothing FAILs (INFO lines are allowed), 1 otherwise.
#
# ONE DEADLINE FOR THE FOUR REACHABILITY CHECKS. Checks 1 through 4 share a
# single budget, the config's timeout, rather than each taking one: a host that
# drops packets instead of refusing them makes every one of those checks wait,
# and per-check timeouts multiply into a run that outlasts its own bound. Each
# boundary call takes what is left of the budget instead of waiting again, and
# a sqlcmd spawn splits its share between the login clock and the query clock,
# which run one after the other.
#
# THE DEADLINE DECIDES WHETHER A CALL STARTS, ITS OWN CLOCK DECIDES HOW LONG IT
# RUNS. Each check screens the deadline before it calls out, which is what
# turns a spent budget into a named check line; the boundary functions keep the
# same screen as a belt that no caller currently reaches. A call that does
# start runs on a whole-second clock divided down from what remains, lifted
# where what remains is under the floor the tool will not go below: two seconds
# for a sqlcmd spawn, which keeps a login clock and a query clock one after the
# other, and one second for an HTTP call. That lift is the one place this
# script's own arithmetic lets a call outrun the deadline, so checks 1 through 4
# finish less than two seconds past the configured timeout, and no call starts
# after it. The bound rests on each tool honouring the clock it is handed:
# sqlcmd's -l and -t, and Invoke-WebRequest's -TimeoutSec. No kill wraps either
# call, so a child that ignores its own clock is bounded by nothing here, and
# what the run reports is the check it was still waiting on. Checks 5 and 6
# stand outside the budget: check 5 because its duration is the measurement, as
# stated below, and check 6 because it spawns only the local tool and reaches no
# host.
#
# A LINE THAT MEASURED NOTHING IS A FAIL, naming what was not read: a probe
# that reports anything else while never reaching the host is the expensive
# lie, since the doctor step reads this run's exit code as the host's health.
# That covers a check the deadline stopped and a reading the config made
# impossible, which is a database name this script will not interpolate.
#
# INFO IS FOR A READING THAT COST THE RUN NOTHING. There are three: check 2's
# line for a database that is simply not on the server yet, which is the
# ordinary state before the installer runs; check 5's skip under -Quick; and
# check 0's note that an out-of-range timeoutMs was replaced by the default,
# after which every check still measures what it was asked for. Check 5 is
# outside the budget on purpose: it runs only after check 4 has proved the
# server answers, and its duration is the measurement being taken, so its calls
# take the per-call timeout and draw on no shared deadline. There are
# twenty-one of them. The first call that does not answer ends the check, so a
# server that stops answering costs one timeout, while a server answering just
# inside the timeout on every call costs twenty-one of them, which is the
# measurement it was asked for. The doctor's step passes -Quick and makes none
# of these calls.
#
# THE PASSWORD NEVER LEAVES THE ENVIRONMENT BLOCK. The config carries a SQL
# login's password, and it reaches sqlcmd through SQLCMDPASSWORD, which this
# script sets for the length of one spawn and restores afterwards. It is never
# a command-line argument (a command line is readable in the process list),
# never an output line, and never part of an error message.
#
# The checks connect to `master`, never to the configured database, because at
# first run that database does not exist yet. Whether it exists is itself
# reported, as INFO.
#
# Requires PowerShell 7: Invoke-WebRequest's -SkipHttpErrorCheck is how check 5
# reads the embedding server's refusal of an oversized input, which is a
# measured result here rather than an error.

#Requires -Version 7.0

# An unrecognised switch must be a hard error, not a silent extra argument: a
