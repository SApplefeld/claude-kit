# Dot-sourced by doctor.ps1 and by the memory database host probe beside the
# installer, so the two scripts that share one output channel (the doctor
# prints the probe's lines under its own step) sanitize it one way. A second
# copy would be one edit away from a cap or a character class the other side
# does not keep.
#
# The cap is the caller's, per channel, because a truncated string is only
# acceptable where nothing compares it: the doctor spends 120 on a line of its
# own report and 200 on a value it quotes, and the probe spends 200 on a check
# line. It is mandatory so a call site states the width it prints at rather
# than inheriting one written for another surface.
