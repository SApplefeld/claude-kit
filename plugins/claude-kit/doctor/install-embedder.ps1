# The doctor's embedder-install and index-health helpers: whether the local
# embedding stack (plugins/claude-kit/scripts/memory-index.js's optional
# in-process model) is installed and usable, installing it under -Fix, and
# reading the derived index's health without touching it.
#
# Dot-sourced by doctor.ps1, which calls these under its "Embedder (semantic
# search)" check; the repo test suite dot-sources the same file and calls the
# same functions against a redirected embedder root and store root, which is
# why both arrive as parameters instead of being resolved from the
# environment here. This file defines functions only; dot-sourcing it runs
# nothing and writes nothing.
#
# Every probe and every warm-up spawns its own node process rather than
# sharing one, and that separation is load-bearing, not incidental:
# memory-index.js sets the embedding library's remote-fetch flag off on a
# process-global environment object, so a process that probes the install and
# then tries to warm the model in the same process would silently download
# nothing. Spawning fresh for each step is what keeps a probe from ever
# sharing a process with a warm-up.
#
# The install location and the store root reach the child node process
# through the same two-variable code/data gates memory-index.js and memq.js
# already define: KIT_EMBEDDER_ROOT plus KIT_EMBEDDER_ROOT_ALLOW_CODE=1 for
# which package gets require()'d, KIT_MEMORY_ROOT plus
# KIT_MEMORY_ROOT_ALLOW_DATA=1 for which store gets read. Setting them here
# rather than trusting the real machine's home directory is what lets the
# test suite drive every function below against a sandbox without ever
# touching the operator's real ~\.claude or ~\.claude\kit-embedder.

# The install size: 398 MB, measured as
# Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Force -File | Measure-Object Length -Sum against the
# whole ~\.claude\kit-embedder directory (node_modules and every dependency
# @huggingface/transformers pulls in, onnxruntime-node and onnxruntime-web
# among them) at @huggingface/transformers 4.2.0, this file's pinned dtype
# (MODEL_DTYPE in memory-index.js). It excludes nothing under that root: the
# figure is the whole directory this section creates, not the package alone.
# Stated here so the consent prompt carries a real figure rather than an
# estimate; re-measure whenever the pinned package changes.
$script:EmbedderConsentSizeMB = 398

# The model download is not pinned to a Hugging Face Hub revision, unlike the
# npm package above: transformers.js caches a non-'main' revision under a
# revision-hash subdirectory (.cache/Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/<sha>/...) rather
# than the plain per-model path it uses for the default branch, and
# memory-index.js's probe checks for the model files at the plain path only.
# Passing a pinned revision to the warm-up therefore downloads correctly but
# leaves the probe unable to find what it downloaded, reporting 'unusable'
# forever. Supporting a pin would mean teaching the probe's file-existence
# check the revision-keyed layout, which is memory-index.js's file and outside
# this round's authorization. Documented limitation, not silently dropped.

# The -e script bodies. Each is spawned as its own node process (see header),
# and each takes the path to memory-index.js as its one positional argument
# (process.argv[1] under node -e; see doctor.ps1's kit-goal-stop.js load
# check for the same convention). None of them import anything this repo does
# not already ship: the embedding package itself is require()'d only inside
# memory-index.js's own loadEmbedder, from the install location the
# environment variables above select.

# Prints probeEmbedder()'s result as JSON. Read-only: probeEmbedder touches

# Downloads and materializes the model, the one step in this whole kit

# loadEmbedder: that function probes first and returns the typed absence
# immediately when the model files are not already on disk, and it never
# turns remote fetching back on once loaded, because every query-path process
# must only ever read what is already cached. Downloading therefore means
# requiring the installed package directly and driving transformers.pipeline
# with the library's own default (fetch allowed), while still pinning both
# model directories to the exact location memory-index.js's probe checks
# (mi.modelCacheDir()), so what lands on disk here is exactly what a later
