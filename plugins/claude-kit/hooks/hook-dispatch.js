// hook-dispatch.js - one process per tool-call event.
//
// hooks.json wires this file alone on PreToolUse and PostToolUse, as
//     node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/hook-dispatch.js" <event>
// and dispatch-table.json, in hooks.json's own shape, names the hooks each
// event routes to and the matcher each is scoped by. The dispatcher reads the
// payload once, selects the hooks the table matches to the payload's tool, runs
// each unmodified hook file in its own worker thread, and answers the harness
// once with the merged result.
//
// Why threads around unmodified files: a hook launched by the harness costs a
// shell, a second shell, a node process and a console host, and a Bash call
// matches nine of them. A hook's own logic is a few milliseconds; the launch is
// the cost. A worker thread gives a hook its own process.exit, its own
// uncaught-exception boundary and its own module cache, so no guard's file
// changes. What the routed hooks do share is one process: its lifetime, its
// working directory and its descriptor table. The lifetime is the one that
// costs something. Node joins its threads on exit, so a thread blocked inside a
// synchronous call holds the process, and every other hook's verdict, until
// the call returns. The bootstrap bounds the synchronous child calls, which are
// the blocking calls the routed hooks make. A thread blocked in anything else,
// a file call on a dead network path for one, is not bounded by anything here.
//
// Exit codes, which are the harness's own:
//   2  at least one hook blocked. stderr carries the blocking hooks' stderr.
//   0  no hook blocked. stdout carries the merged answer, when there is one.
//   1  a hook failed without blocking and nothing else had anything to say.
//
// A thread that cannot start, or that ends without having written an answer,
// sends its hook through a child process, which is the launch this file
// replaced. KIT_HOOK_DISPATCH=legacy forces that path for every hook. A fault
// in the merge keeps any block the hooks returned and runs nothing twice. A routing table
// that cannot be read falls back to the copy of it held below, so an unusable
// file costs no guard its call. What none of that covers is a native abort,
// which ends the process and every hook in it with a code that does not block.
