// SessionEnd hook: key every pointer the judged fleet block showed this session
// and the session never read to an outcome row, then clear the session's
// entries from the shown file.
//
// The judged fleet block records each candidate it judged in the project's
// `.kit/jev-shown.json`, under the session id, and `memq get` of a shown name
// marks that name's entries and writes a `kit.jev.pointer` pass row. What is
// still unmarked when the session ends is a pointer the session saw and did not
// open, so this hook writes one `kit.jev.pointer` fail row for each shown entry
// of its own session still unmarked, removes every entry of its own session,
// runs memq's stale sweep over the rest, and deletes the file once no entry
// remains. The sweep drops every entry older than seven days whoever wrote it,
// with a fail row for each one shown and unmarked, so a session killed before
// its own SessionEnd still has its misses counted. A peer session's entry
// younger than that bound is never read or touched. A miss is thereby a row
// rather than an absence, which is what lets the calibration query count it.
//
// SessionEnd rather than Stop, because Stop fires at the end of every response
// turn and an unread row written there would count every pointer as missed
// after one turn. The session id is the payload's `session_id`, which names the
// same session as the `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` its tool shells carry, and the
// project is the payload's `cwd`, the directory the session-start block wrote
// the file under.
//
// Every rule about the file and the journal comes from memq.js and jev-judge.js,
// which own them: the file's path, its bounded reader, its lock and its entry
// shape, the journal's write, and the shared index's local queue behind it.
// This hook restates none of them.
//
// SAFETY: never blocks, never speaks. Every path ends at exit 0 and this hook
// writes nothing to stdout or stderr: an unparseable payload, an id not of a
// session's shape, a working directory on a network share with no store pin,
// an absent or unreadable file, a lock held past its short wait, and a failed
// require all end silently.
