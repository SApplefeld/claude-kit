// Invoked by the executing-work chapter-close ritual after a Chapter is
// appended and the section's commit model has been honored. An open checkpoint
// tells the PreCompact gate (kit-compact-gate.js) that a chapter boundary has
// been reached: the gate allows the next auto-compaction attempt and consumes
// the checkpoint, so each open lands exactly one compaction. Opening requires
// an armed kit goal, because the checkpoint records the armed plan path and
// the gate treats a checkpoint naming any other plan as absent: with no goal
// armed there is nothing the file could ever match, so the open refuses
// rather than writing a dead checkpoint. All filesystem work is delegated to
// kit-compact-lib.js; this file is only argument parsing and output
// formatting, matching kit-goal.js.
