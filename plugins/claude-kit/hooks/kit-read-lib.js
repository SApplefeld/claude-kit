// Shared bounded reader for the kit's hooks: one file's bytes, and one
// directory's names. Every hook read of a file whose size and kind the caller
// does not control, and every listing of a directory whose length it does not
// control, runs through here, so the properties that make such a read unsafe
// are closed in one place instead of at each call site.
//
// The kind is settled on the descriptor. A FIFO reports size 0, passes any size
// ceiling, and then blocks inside open() until a writer appears, and no try
// around the open can rescue that: the call never returns. The kit's readers run
// inside SessionStart and Stop hooks that block a session, in whatever directory
// the session opened, including a clone of this public repository nobody has
// read, so a FIFO named docs/backlog.md would hold every session start in that
// checkout open forever. Two things close it together, the pair readGitPointer
// in kit-goal-lib.js carries for the goal pointer's read: off win32 the open
// itself is non-blocking, which is what makes opening a FIFO return rather than
// wait, and the kind verdict is then taken from an fstat on the open
// descriptor. Judging a name and then opening that name leaves the window a
// local process swaps the file inside; a descriptor answers only for the file
// that was actually opened.
//
// The size that bounds the read is the descriptor's for the same reason read
// the other way. A size taken off a name before the open describes whatever
// stood there then, so a file that grew in between comes back short while its
// own flag calls it whole, which is a partial reading reaching a session as a
// total. The ordinary read stats no path before the open, which also means a
// symlink into a dead network mount fails at the open the OS is already timing
// rather than stalling in a stat first. The one exception is stated where it is
// taken: a caller that opts into the link refusal below runs an lstat first on a
// platform with no O_NOFOLLOW, because there the name is the only place that
// question can be asked at all.
//
// The read fills its buffer. A single readSync may legally return fewer bytes
// than asked for, so a caller that treats one call's return as the whole file
// gets a truncation it cannot see: the count it takes off that text reads as a
// total, and the file's own size says the read was complete.
//
// A result that is not the whole file says so, and says WHICH bound stopped it.
// Two things make a read partial, a file larger than the ceiling and a fill loop
// that ended short of what the descriptor promised, and a caller summarizing
// what it read needs the same answer from both, because a summary presented as a
// total is wrong for either reason. A caller whose two directions differ in cost
// needs them apart instead, which is why the flag is answered beside a named
// bound rather than alone: the ceiling binding says the file is larger than this
// caller's cap, which is a fact about the file, while a short fill says the file
// was truncated under the read or a device stopped answering, which any file at
// all can do at any moment. A writer that removes a file on the strength of "not
// mine" may act on the first and must not act on the second.
// When the result is partial the trailing fragment goes with it: a byte
// cut lands mid-line and possibly mid-codepoint, so everything after the last
// newline is discarded and a caller only ever sees whole lines. Left in, a line
// counter counts a fragment as an item and a date scanner reads a severed token
// as no date at all.
//
// A listing says the same thing about a directory: a cap that binds, or a
// directory that will not answer, leaves names unseen, and a caller counting
// what it got needs to know that before it renders the count as a total.
//
// The boundary is shared rather than per-caller because an unexported one is the
// fix the next author reimplements by not implementing it: these properties
// belong to the act of reading what a repository supplies, not to the one caller
// that first needed them. kit-git-lib.js holds the same shape for the spawn
// boundary.
//
// Node core modules, plus one rule borrowed from kit-goal-lib.js rather than
// spelled a second time here: normalizePlanArg's containment test, which
// containedRealPath answers to. CommonJS, no third-party dependencies.
//
// readFileBounded never throws: a missing file, a path that is not a regular
// file, and a read that fails all degrade to a null the caller reads. readFully
// answers to its caller's try instead, handing back a bad descriptor's EBADF
// and an over-large length's RangeError, since the caller owns the descriptor
// and the window and is the only one able to say what a failure of either
// means.

//              than ceilingBytes, 'short-fill' when the fill loop ended short of
//              what the descriptor promised, and null when the result is whole.
//              A read that hits both is 'short-fill', because that is the
//              reading a caller must not treat as a file too large to be its
//              own: the ceiling is a fact about the file, while a short fill
//              says only that this read did not finish.
//
// The open follows a symlink rather than refusing one by default, because the
// question here is what the read would block on: a link to a regular file reads
// exactly like that file, while a link to a FIFO fstats as a FIFO and is refused
// with it. A caller whose subject must not be a link out of its own tree judges
// that itself before calling, through containedRealPath below.
//
// `options.refuseLink` is the other question, asked here rather than by hand at
// each caller that needs it: is the FINAL COMPONENT itself a link? A caller
// whose subject is a file its own writer creates and renames into place wants
// that refusal, because a link planted at the path redirects the read to
// whatever it names and a link into a dead network mount stalls the open. It is
// opt-in and defaults off, so a caller that means to read through a link (a
// checkout reached through one, a settings file an operator has linked into
// place) keeps reading exactly what it read before. Off it costs nothing at all,
// and no caller pays for a property it did not ask for.
//
// Where the platform can express it, the refusal rides the OPEN rather than a
// stat on the name, which is the same descriptor-settled reasoning the kind and
// the size take above: O_NOFOLLOW makes the open itself fail on a link at the
// final component, so there is no window between a verdict about a name and an
// open of that name for a local process to swap the file inside. win32 has no
// O_NOFOLLOW (fs.constants.O_NOFOLLOW is undefined there) and no way to reach
// FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT through fs, so that platform takes the siblings'
// rule instead, an lstat that refuses a link before the open, which NARROWS the
// window rather than closing it. The residue is the asking caller's to bound and
// differs with what it reads, so it is stated per caller rather than once for the
// option. The hold-stamp read (readHoldNudgesResult in kit-compact-lib.js) is
// the one that file's own hand-written preamble already states this residue
// for: the window is a few microseconds per fire on a path inside a project's
// .kit/, which an actor able to plant a link there can already write to, and
// what a swap landing in it yields is a foreign file's bytes rebuilt field by
// field into stamps rather than anything echoed or executed. The signpost read
// (nudgeFloor in compact-deferral-nudge.js) reads ~/.claude/claude-kit.local.json,
// a path under the operator's own home rather than inside any repository, so
// reaching its window needs a writer already in that directory; what rides
// through it is one number the caller clamps to a finite non-negative value,
// and an open that a swapped link stalls is bounded by the harness's own hook
// timeout, which costs that hook's directive and nothing beyond it. The nudge-log
// read (readNudgeLog in memory-recognition-nudge.js) reads a file that hook
// writes and appends to itself through an O_NOFOLLOW open, so the option is what
// makes the reader refuse what the writer already refuses; what rides through
// the window is one hook's own observability window, and a refusal reads there as
