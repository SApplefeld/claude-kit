//
// `push` is the stamping helper the seat's own status push calls. The registry
// entry is single-writer under the role skill's directory contract, the
// registering session plus the two machine-stamped lines the seat-stop hook and
// the compaction checkpoint CLI own, so `Started:` and `Status-updated:` stay
// the session's fields and this verb changes who reads the clock rather than
// who writes the line: the session composes its `Remaining:` and `Status:`
// prose and runs this last, so the moments on the entry are an instrument's.
// Nothing else in the entry is touched.
//
// `now` is the same repair where there is no line to rewrite. A coordinator
// board line carries the time of its evidence inside its own prose, and only
// the coordinator writes that file, so nothing can stamp a field there; what a
// tool can do is supply the moment, which is the half a writer gets wrong.
//
// `audit` is the reading side. Three readings, each resting on a value the
// artifact's own writer did not supply:
//
//   1. A session-written registry stamp falling on a whole second. This is a
//      population reading and never a per-seat verdict. This stamper never
//      writes one, since it moves a whole-second read forward a millisecond,
//      so the stamp came from another writer: a hand-typed moment lands there
//      almost every time, and another tool's honest clock read about once in
//      a thousand, which is the harmless direction to fail. So it says
//      something about a directory of entries and nothing about the seat that
//      wrote any one of them.
//   2. A session-written registry stamp leading that entry's hook-stamped
//      `Heartbeat:` by more than the heartbeat throttle window. The heartbeat
//      is machine written, so the comparison needs no second clock and catches
//      the fabricated-forward stamp the round-second reading cannot see. The
//      window is the throttle itself, since a stop after a push restamps the
//      heartbeat unless the throttle refuses it, so an honest push sits at most
//      one throttle window ahead of the heartbeat once the session has stopped.
//      The hook stamps at a turn end and nowhere else, so a push made inside
//      a turn that has not ended yet legitimately leads the heartbeat from
//      the previous turn's end and reads here exactly as a fabricated stamp
//      does. That false positive is admitted rather than screened out, for
//      the arithmetic reason `stampsLeadingHeartbeat` states at its own
//      definition, which is why this reading produces a report and never a
//      verdict.
//   3. Any stamp, in an entry or in a board line, sitting ahead of the clock
//      past the skew the compaction checkpoint allows for one. The board takes
//      this reading alone: it carries no machine-written comparator for reading
//      2, and its evidence times are legitimately written at minute precision,
//      so reading 1 over it would fire on honest lines. Its stamps are found by
//      their ISO shape inside the prose, the board having no field grammar to
//      read them out of.
//
// The board read is the one the operator-tier location record names for this
// machine through its `board:` key, else the directory contract's `board.md`;
// where neither holds a file the run says the board leg did not run.
//
// Every finding is a report and gates nothing. The audit writes nothing and
// reads entries through the same screen the mechanical stampers read them
// through. What it never does is confuse scanning nothing with finding nothing.
// The only scope it scans is one machine's directory under the coordinator
// root, judged on the real path rather than the spelling; anything else is
// refused and named, the root itself and a directory inside a machine's
// included, since neither holds artifacts of this shape and a clean reading of
// either would say the machine is clean when nothing about it was read. An
// unreadable artifact inside a scanned scope is itself a finding, a listing too
// large to read whole is reported as partial, and every run states what it
// scanned. The exit code carries three states: 0 for a clean scan, 1 for a scan
// that produced findings (an unreadable artifact and a partial listing both
// count as findings), and 2 for any run where nothing was scanned at all: a
// refusal, a kit library that would not load, or an unexpected error. A caller
// reads the result from the exit code rather than from a grep over the text.

// Containment is judged on the real path through the shared link-resolving
// screen rather than on the spelling, because a lexical test reads a link's own
// name and never where it goes, so a link planted under the root would carry
// the scan wherever it points. One residual is left standing rather than
// claimed away: resolving a link is itself a touch, so a junction aimed at an
// unreachable share still costs this the connection's timeout at the resolve.
// What the screen buys is that the scan does not then proceed there, which is
// the reach the lexical test did not have.
//
// Depth is the second screen and it is what stops the audit reporting on a
// scope nobody asked about. The root holds one directory per machine and the
// artifacts sit inside those, so a machine directory is exactly one component
// below the root: the root itself and `<root>/<machine>/registry` both contain
// no `registry/` and no board of their own, and a scan of either
// finds nothing because there is nothing of this shape there, not because the
// machine is clean. Requiring the depth refuses both, while a machine directory
// that genuinely holds nothing yet still scans and still reports honestly.
//
// Absence is kept apart from both screens and answers in its own words. A
// mistyped machine name resolves to a path this would have scanned, and calling
// that out of scope sends the caller hunting the wrong mistake; the two are the
// same silence and different repairs. The order is what makes the extra answer
// safe: the lexical depth screen runs first and touches nothing, so only a path
// already inside the root is ever stat'd, and no value outside it learns from
// this whether it exists.

// it for the same reason and a caller reading the reason should not be able to

// whose `machine:` names this host, under memq's own machine-equality rule
// (foreignMachine), read from one read of the record's text through the same
// capped reader every artifact in this audit takes. A record that reader
// refuses is not a candidate: its `board:` key is never read, and its name
// rides in `unreadable` with the reader's own reason. Its machine is unknown
// for the same reason, so it is reported whichever machine it describes, and
// it never counts toward ambiguity: a readable keyed record beside it is still
// the location, with the unread record reported as a finding. The path is
// read from the record's `board:` frontmatter key and never out of its prose,
// so a seat and this audit take the location from one keyed value. One candidate
// carrying the key is the location. More than one is `ambiguous`, which names
// each and leaves the leg unscanned rather than choosing. A candidate with no
// key is the same as no record, and its name rides in `keyless` so the report
// can say what the record lacks. A key whose value the recorded-path screen
// refuses rides in `refused` with the rule it met, and is never opened.
//
// The tier is memq's, resolved through memq's own store root, so an honored
// store override moves it exactly as it moves every other store read. memq is
// loaded here rather than at the top of the file, because only this leg needs
// it. A memq that will not load, or a tier path it cannot resolve, is `unread`,
// so the report says the location went unread rather than that there is none,
