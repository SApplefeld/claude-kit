// The fleet memory block's judge: the policy that sits between the shared
// memory database's search shortlist and the block session start and `memq
// recall` print. It composes the situation the judge reads, asks TypeSafe's
// Jev one question per candidate through the shared client, selects what the
// block shows, and records what it judged, so that an outcome can be keyed to
// each judged candidate by its recognition id. The block itself (the database
// query, the hit shape and the line rendering) stays in memq.js, which calls
// the pieces here in order.
//
// WHERE THE DATA GOES. One call sends the composed situation as state, and each
// candidate's name, description and status inside its question, to the
// endpoint the shared client reads from `~/.claude/kit-jev.json`. Record bodies
// never ride: a candidate is built from three fields of a search row and
// nothing else, and the question shape is the one the recognition battery
// measured the floors with. The situation is assembled from files and never
// from a model: the in-progress plan's Goal, its Intent where it has one, and
// the full text of the section its latest Chapter's `Next:` line names; on a
// resume or a compaction the operator's last message from the transcript joins
// it; with no plan in progress the branch name and the last three commit
// titles stand in; and a `memq recall` may pass its own one-line situation.
//
// THE POLICY LIVES HERE AND NOT IN THE CLIENT. The fetch limit, the two floors,
// the budget edge and the retry delay are this module's constants. The shared
// client holds no caller's policy, so a coverage check that waits twenty
// seconds and this judge that must answer inside a session start share one
// wire and two policies.
//
// EVERY FAILURE IS A STAND-DOWN, NEVER A THROW. A judge that cannot answer
// resolves to a reason and the sentence the block prints beside the vector
// list it shows instead; a judge that is not configured resolves to a reason
// and no sentence, since a machine with no config hears nothing about one.
// No sentence here is built from a runtime error's message, on the client's
// own rule: a thrown call is named as a failed call and nothing more.
//
// THE KEY. This module never reads `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`. The client reads it
// inside the call and returns no object that carries it, so nothing here can
// write it: not the shown file, not a stand-down line, not a thrown error.
