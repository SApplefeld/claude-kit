// The kit's client for the operator's local model endpoint: the config read,
// the POST transport, and the classification of what came back.
//
// It lives in the shipped plugin tree because two trees need it. `sidecar/` is
// the judge daemon's directory and is run from the working clone; it is not
// packaged, while everything under plugins/claude-kit/ is. memq ships, so a
// require from memq into sidecar/ would resolve in a working clone and fail in
// every installed copy of the plugin. Extracting rather than duplicating is
// what keeps the two things below from drifting apart between the daemon and
// the CLI, and both of them are dangerous to hold twice.
//
// WHERE THE DATA GOES. This module is the point at which content leaves this
// machine. Every request POSTs whatever its caller built to the endpoint named
// in `~/.claude/kit-endpoint.json`. That endpoint does not run on this VM: it
// runs on the Hyper-V host, reached across the virtual switch, over plain HTTP
// with no authentication in the fleet's default configuration, and it is shared
// with other tenants of that host including the operator's own agent harness.
// Nothing here redacts. Each caller's own header states what it sends.
//
// TWO WIRE PROTOCOLS, ONE REQUEST SHAPE. Callers build an Ollama-style
// generate request (`system`, `prompt`, `format`, `think`, `options`) and
// read an Ollama-style answer (`response`, `done_reason`). The config's `api`
// key names what the endpoint actually speaks: `ollama` posts that request as
// it stands to `/api/generate`; `openai` translates it to a chat-completions
// request for `/v1/chat/completions` (which llama-server and most other local
// servers serve) and translates the answer back, so no caller knows which
// server it is talking to. The translation is the whole of the difference,
// and it lives here so that the three callers cannot drift apart on it.
//
// THE ADDRESS IS NOT IN THIS REPOSITORY, which is public. It exists only in
// that config file and in the operator's own memory tier, is read at run time,
// and lands in no comment, log line, record or test. What travels instead is a
// truncated hash of the host, enough to notice that the endpoint changed and
// far too little to be a copy of it.
//
// FOUR TRANSPORT OUTCOMES, NOT TWO. A caller's resilience policy differs by
// outcome, so this module never collapses them:
//
//   ok           the endpoint answered 2xx with a JSON body and no error key
//   timeout      the request outran its own clock; the lane is serial and has a
//                standing second tenant, so this is a queue, not a fault
//   unreachable  the connection itself failed; the runner may be restarting,
//                which is the one outcome that earns a retry
//   refused      the endpoint answered and said no: a non-2xx status, an error
//                body, or a body that could not be read
//
// The fifth outcome a caller acts on, `unusable`, is the caller's: whether an
// answer is a verdict, a list of record names or a ranking is a question about
// the schema that caller asked for, and this module never sees it.
//
// Nothing here throws on a bad config, and no transport failure throws either.
// A missing, unreadable, malformed or incomplete config all return a described
// refusal that the caller reports and stands down on. A stack trace out of a
// process that simply has no endpoint on its machine would be a false alarm
// dressed as a fault.

// a host that is up but serving nothing fails fast while one to a host that is
// gone hangs until the clock runs out. The daemon has no use for it and does
// not call it: a batch pass behind a serial lane learns the same fact from the
// generation it was going to make anyway.
//
// ANY answer is `ok`, including a non-2xx one. The question here is liveness,
// not correctness: something is listening and speaking HTTP. What the endpoint
// then makes of a real request is the generation call's answer to give, under
// its own classification, so a probe that pre-judged it would degrade a working
// endpoint on the strength of an unrelated status code. The body is discarded
// rather than read, since nothing here reads it and an unread body pins a
